        to my virtual location. My name is Elnur. My #1 passion is coding...
        This is not only the way to make money, but also a means to make myself
        happy. If I don't get enough chance to do good amount of coding (problem
        solving) at my daily work (due to meetings, events etc.), at home you
        can expect me to find a problem, solve it and make it an app. Usually
        whenever I get some free time, I ask myself a question: Should I play a
        console game or or should I code something ?.. Guess what, %90 of times
        I select the second. So, it is pretty natural if you receive an email
        from me around 3am - I am usually busy doing some coding till then.

        I love discussing the latest tech trends, to explain, teach whatever I
        know or learned recently. I believe knowledge is only beautiful when it
        is shared. I also love to learn new stuff. My philosphy/rule to start
        learning is "meeting twice". Basically whenever I hear/see someting new
        for the first time I ignore it. If I encounter with it for the second
        time, no way I can let it pass. That should be mine... I must learn it
        and for sure apply it whenever can be and needed. I may not update this
        website very frequently, sorry if you felt that, please, feel free to
        check out my LinkedIn profile as it is usually more up-to-date. If you
        have something to tell me, please, do not hesitate to drop a line for me
        in contact page or via LinkedIn. I am more than happy to hear and meet
        new people as it is always fun. Thanks.
