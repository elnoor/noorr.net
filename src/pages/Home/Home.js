        to my online presence.&nbsp; My name is Elnur and coding is my true
        passion. To me, it's not just a way to earn a living, but it brings me
        joy and fulfillment. When I don't have enough opportunities to code
        during my work hours due to meetings and events, I like to find new
        problems to solve and turn them into apps in my free time. More often
        than not, when I have some spare time, I ask myself "should I play a
        video game or code something?" and you guessed it, coding wins out 90%
        of the time. So, don't be surprised if you receive an email from me at
        3am, I may be busy coding up until then.

        I enjoy discussing the latest technology trends and sharing my knowledge
        and insights with others. I believe that knowledge is only valuable when
        it's shared, and I'm always eager to learn something new. My rule for
        learning is "meeting twice". When I first encounter something new, I
        ignore it. But if I see it a second time, I know I must learn it and
        apply it wherever I can.
